# VisionFlow-
1	INTRODUCTION
This chapter introduces the VISIONFLOW PLUS project, outlining its purpose, objectives, and significance. It offers a robust suite of tools for every stage of the workflow, including data acquisition, labeling, model training, and optimization.
1.1	System Introduction 
VisionFlow Plus is an online platform designed for the computer vision students and Ai engineers to build and deploy the computer vision models for various applications. Vision Flow Plus offers a comprehensive suite of tools and features to assist developers, researchers, and businesses in training, optimizing, and deploying computer vision models efficiently.
1.2	Background of the System
•	Existing Systems

Existing systems typically focus solely on image data, training models exclusively on images without leveraging cloud resources. They also limit data provision to one format only, lacking flexibility.

•	Our Contribution

Our contribution expands beyond image data, incorporating textual data into model training. Additionally, we offer cloud resources for enhanced model training, ensuring scalability and efficiency. By prescribing suitable models based on the dataset characteristics, we optimize performance and accuracy. Finally, we provide trained models, empowering users to seamlessly integrate them into their code for testing and deployment.
